## Disclaimer
This project is a hobby, lots of idea but not much time invested.

# HeirsOfValia
Co-op dungeon exploration

# Initial idea
Inspiration: Outer Wilds, Sea of Thieves, The Maze Runner
A dungeon-crawler co-op game with an accent on coordination, exploration, and short sessions.

# Core concepts
## Same rooms, different layouts
For each game, the dungeon is based on a random layout but always composed of the same rooms.
What varies is the links between those rooms and your discoveries that allow you to go from one to another.

## Clocked exploration
You always start from the camp, and go into the dungeon. After a limited amount of time, an event forces you back to the camp.
You then have to plan on how to go further the next day.

## Find relics
They give you abilities, belong to sets, and help you go always further inside the dungeon.

# State of the project
- Dungeon layout generation
